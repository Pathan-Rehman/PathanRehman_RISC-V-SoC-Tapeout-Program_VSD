# üñ•Ô∏è RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD**! This repository chronicles my detailed week-by-week progress, featuring the tasks and milestones I accomplish throughout the program.

This program guides me through designing a complete System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL all the way to GDSII layout using open-source tools. It is part of India‚Äôs largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, which empowers over 3,500 participants to build silicon and actively contribute to advancing the nation‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem.
