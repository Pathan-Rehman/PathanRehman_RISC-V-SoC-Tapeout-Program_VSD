# üñ•Ô∏è RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD**! This repository chronicles my detailed week-by-week progress, featuring the tasks and milestones I accomplish throughout the program.  

This program guides me through designing a complete System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL all the way to GDSII layout using open-source tools. It is part of India‚Äôs largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering over 3,500 participants to build silicon and actively contribute to advancing the nation‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem.

## üìÖ Week 0 ‚Äî Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Task 1](./Week-0/Task-1/README.md) | Summary of **Getting started with Digital VLSI SOC Design and Planning** video: overview of SoC design flow from application validation, RTL design, to physical tapeout | ‚úÖ Completed |
| [Task 2](./Week-0/Task-2/README.md) | Tools Installation ‚Äî Successfully installed open-source EDA tools: Icarus Verilog, Yosys, and GTKWave for RTL simulation and synthesis | ‚úÖ Completed |

### üåü Key Learnings from Week 0

- Understood the VLSI SOC design flow starting from modeling applications in C, specification validation using different compilers (GCC, RISC-V GCC), RTL coding and simulation, SOC partitioning, to physical design and chip tapeout.
- Successfully set up the development environment with essential open-source electronic design automation (EDA) tools‚Äîbuilding the foundation for RTL verification and synthesis.
- Prepared the system for upcoming VLSI design stages involving RTL design validation, synthesis with Yosys, and waveform visualization using GTKWave in preparation for physical design steps.
