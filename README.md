# PathanRehman_RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program_VSD
I am learning to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to final GDSII using open-source tools as part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative. Through this experience, I join over 3,500 participants in building silicon and actively contributing to the nation’s growing semiconductor ecosystem.
